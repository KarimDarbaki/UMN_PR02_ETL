## Project 2: ETL Challenge

This project was completed by Karim, Mikhail, Josh and Michael.

## Data sources

### 1. Data World

An extensive research on MLS players' salaries lead us to discovery of a data sheet of detailed salary information on the Data.world website. The data is open to download in csv format.

### 2. MLS Soccer

The games stats per season can be found at MLSsoccer.com website, categorized by seasons. We pulled the data by iterating through seasons using Pandas.

## Data storage

For storing data together for future analysis a sqlite database was chosen as the most versatile database engine.

The database schema was defined [quickdatabasediagrams.com](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com) as follows:
